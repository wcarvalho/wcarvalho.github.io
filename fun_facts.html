    As part of an <a href="http://biochemnewsletter.com/sbu-wins-1-4-million-nih-grant-to-support-underrepresented-undergrad-and-doctoral-researchers/">initiative to increase minority representation in STEM </a> by combating it at one of its roots: poor math performance, I led a supplemental calculus course at <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a>.
