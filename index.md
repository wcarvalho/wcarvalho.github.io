My name is Wilka[^1] Torrico De Carvalho and I am an Afro-Latino, socially sensitive, aspiring brain and machine learning scientist. I am currently a PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of Michigan--Ann Arbor and an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF graduate research fellow in neuroscience</a> exploring principled methods of analyzing the mind and brain. Among those which excite me most are 
<!-- http://gershmanlab.webfactional.com/pubs/GershmanNiv12.pdf -->
1. [Bayesian nonparametric methods](http://gershmanlab.webfactional.com/pubs/GershmanBlei12.pdf) for its ability to specify methods by which humans might define (potentially) infinite hidden variables in response to observed data;
2. [reinforcement learning](https://www.princeton.edu/~nivlab/papers/NivLangdon2016.pdf) for its ability to elucidate how humans may place value on what they encounter in attempts to optimize their experience; and
3. [artificial neural networks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26906502) for their potential to give insight into how neural networks can incorporate mechanisms for learning hidden variables into their topology.
 <!-- (e.g., convolutional neural networks have been shown to inadvertently learn visual primitives like edges and contours). -->

My long term goal is to develop and advance unified theoretical models for cognition, behavior, and learning that I may corroborate through experimental work with humans  and through AI-based computer simulations. Here are some [behavioral questions]({{ site.baseurl }}/questions) that I plan to tackle with my research.

As a member of groups underrepresented in research and academia, outreach is important to me. I encourage all young scholars (especially those from marginalized backgrounds) to reach out to me with any questions. Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) pursuing computational methods of studying the mind and brain, pursuing undergraduate research, applying for fellowships, and graduate school. Lastly, [increasing minority representation in STEM is important to me](https://medium.com/@wcarvalho92/a-statement-on-the-importance-of-representation-of-minority-groups-be400d98686). Please feel free to reach out if this applies to you or if you are organizing any relevant programs.

I also maintain a collection of resources for 
* [pursuing a PhD/Graduate School](https://wcarvalho.github.io/Phd-Resources/) (writing resources, career advice, and funding resources)
* [learning about/doing research in machine learning, computational cognitive science, and computational neuroscience](https://wcarvalho.github.io/ML-Brain-Resources/) (including online courses in mathematics, AI, neuroscience, and cognitive science)
